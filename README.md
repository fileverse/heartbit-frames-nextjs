# Heartbit x Frames x Gnosis

Frames have taken the social fi space by storm and rightly so. They are easiest way to find crypto specific audience that know what is a wallet and how to use it.

With heartbit being a tool for measuring engagement we created a simple frame with heartbit integrated for measuring engagements of the user.

## Getting Started

1. Clone / Fork this repo and deploy the basic frame to vercel. 
2. Check if everything looks good setup wise by verifying the deployed url in frames checker.
3. You can then tweak the frame as you see fit and for your usecase. You can also use this just as a working heartbit x frame example in case you get stuck while integrating it in your usecase.

For running the development server on your local:

```bash
# set your .env.local vars as per the .env.example
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
