# Heartbit x Frames

This repo is designed to help you take advantage of crypto native distribution channels and social media. It breaks down the requirements for deploying Farcaster Frames and/or Lens OpenActions with HeartBit to improve user experience. 

Using this HeartBit x Frame SDK you will be able to leverage Smart Accounts with several decentralized protocols, including the Safe Protocol and Pimlico with your Frame (using also Paradigm‚Äôs Frog frame framework or a Nexjs frame generator).

## Getting Started

1. Clone / Fork this repo and deploy the basic frame to vercel. 
2. Check if everything looks good setup wise by verifying the deployed url in frames checker.
3. You can then tweak the frame as you see fit and for your usecase. You can also use this just as a working heartbit x frame example in case you get stuck while integrating it in your usecase.

For running the development server on your local:

```bash
# set your .env.local vars as per the .env.example
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploying
